# LPC1113_Uart_Event

Working simple Uart, GPIO and timer interrupt example for NXP LPC1113F/301 MCU for gcc-toolchain on Visual Studio Code.
The receive function of Uart is realized using interrupts.
The VS-Code extensions CMake, CMake Tool and Cortex-Debug are used.
(only "buildType": "Debug" is realized)

It's a working example but is not elaborated or exensively tested (only to show how it basicly works)
